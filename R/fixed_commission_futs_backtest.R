#' Wrangle Futures Contracts for Simulation using Open Interest
#'
#' @description This is a helper function for determining when to roll futures
#' contracts based on open interest and extracting data required for simulations
#' that include the roll.
#'
#' The roll happens the day after a new contract is identified as having the
#' maximum open interest at the close.
#'
#' Example: CME gold futures (GC)
#'  2021-01-15: G has highest OI
#'  2021-01-19: J has highest OI (no trading 16-19)
#'  2021-01-20: we roll into J (previous_contract and close_previous_contract
#'  correspond to G, current_contract and close_current_contract to J)

#' Futures Backtest, roll on days to expiry, fixed commission model
#'
#' @description Event-based simulation based on desired futures positions, raw
#' contract prices (ie not backadjusted) and roll dates determine by maximum
#' open interest.
#'
#' The function is quite opinionated with respect to the data that it expects.
#' The idea is that user effort is spent in upstream data wrangling (the
#' `wrangle_contracts_on_oi`, `make_sim_prices_matrix`, and
#' `make_sim_weights_matrix` functions help with this), and the payoff is an
#' extremely efficient backtesting routine, enabling fast experimentation with
#' parameters such as `trade_buffer` and different commission models.
#'
#' **Assumptions and considerations**:
#' - Won't allow a position that would be rejected by the broker given user-
#' supplied margin requirements. Positions that would be rejected are
#' automatically scaled back.
#' - Similarly, force liquidates the portfolio to conform with margin
#' requirements (ie simulates a margin call). Contracts are liquidated in equal
#' proportion - which may not be how a broker actually performs this operation.
#' - Trades only integer number of contracts.
#' - User-specified leverage should be embedded in the target weights values.
#' - Currently only fixed commission models are implemented.
#' - Actual positions are determined using a trade buffer approach: when an
#' actual portfolio weight differs from its target weight by `trade_buffer` or
#' more, rebalance back to the target weight plus or minus the `trade_buffer`
#' depending on which side of the target weight the current weight lies.
#' - Uses a user-supplied constant margin requirement for all assets in the
#' portfolio (TODO: support asset-wise margin requirements)
#' - It is up to the user to align weights and prices prior to passing to this
#' function. Weights should be date-aligned with the prices at which you assume
#' you trade into them. This means that you will generally need to lag your
#' weights upstream.
#'
#'
#' @param prices Matrix of trade prices as per output of
#' `make_sim_prices_matrix`. Column 1 must be the
#' timestamp or index in numerical format.
#' @param target_weights Matrix of target weights as per output of
#' `make_sim_weights_matrix`. Column 1 must be the timestamp or index in
#' numerical format.
#' @param interest_rates Matrix of daily interest rate applied to cash balance.
#' Ensure that the rate is adjusted to reflect daily interest. For instance,
#' many sources quote the rate in %pa - this would require dividing by (365*100).
#' @param trade_buffer Trade buffer parameter to prevent hyperactive trading
#' back to the target weights. When an actual portfolio weight differs from its
#' target weight by `trade_buffer` or more, rebalance back to the target weight
#' plus or minus the `trade_buffer` depending on which side of the target weight
#' the current weight lies. This is theoretically optimal if costs are linear.
#' @param initial_cash Inital cash balance.
#' @param margin Margin requirement as proportion of position value. Currently
#' a constant value for all assets.
#' @param capitalise_profits If TRUE, utilise profits and initial cash balance
#' in determining position sizes. If FALSE, profits accrue as a cash balance and
#' are not reinvested.
#' @param commission_fun Function for determining commissions from prices and
#' trades
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to commission_fun. For
#' `futs_per_contract_commission`, this will be `per_contract_commission` (a
#' vector of commissions per contract).
#'
#' @return long dataframe of results consisting of the following columns:
#'  symbol: Futures symbol without contract designation (eg ES, GC, ZB, etc)
#'  date: In YYYY-MM-DD format
#'  close: Closing contract USD value determined from closing_price*point_value.
#'  contracts: Number of contracts held.
#'  exposure: Value of exposure to current symbol or to Cash.
#'  margin: Dollar value of margin required to maintain exposure.
#'  interest: Interest accrued on yesterday's cash balance and settled today.
#'  settled_cash: Cash settled due to holding positions from yesterday's close
#'  through today's close.
#'  contract_trades: Number of contracts traded, including any positions that
#'  were liquidated fully or partially.
#'  trade_value: Value of contracts traded, including any positions that
#'  were liquidated fully or partially.
#'  rolled_contracts: Number of contracts that were rolled out of today.
#'  roll_price: Price at which rolled contracts were covered (NA if no contracts
#'  were rolled).
#'  commission: Commissions paid on today's trading, including any liquidated
#'  and/or rolled contracts.
#'  margin_call: Boolean indicating whether a margin call occurred today.
#'  reduced_target_pos: Boolean indicating whether target positions could not be
#'  executed due to insufficient margin, and were scaled back accordingly.
